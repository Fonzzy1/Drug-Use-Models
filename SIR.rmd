# SIR assumptions
- Individuals belong to one of three groups, suseptible, infected or recovered
- The normal SIR model assumes that recovered people cannot retun to the infected category, this is not the case with drug use, where relaspse is prevelant
- Change is limited to day by day
- the rate of movement between groups is linear such that:
$$ \frac{ds}{dt} = -a \cdot s $$
$$ \frac{di}{dt} = a \cdot s + b \cdot r - c  \cdot i $$
$$ \frac{dr}{dt} =  -b \cdot r + c \cdot i $$
It can be seen then:
$$ \frac{dr}{dt} + \frac{dr}{dt} + \frac{dr}{dt} = 0 $$

## Paramaters:
a - rate people move from suseptible to infected as portion of total people
b - rate people move from recovered to infected as portion of total people
c - rate people move from infected to recovered as portion of total people

- This model is iterative, meaning $x_{n+1} = A \cdot X_n$, which can then be expanded over time.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

pop_init = 100

a = 0.1
b = 0.01
c = 0.2

steps = 100

vect_initial = np.array(pop_init,0,0]).T # vector of day index, suseptable, infected and recovered people

matrix_step = np.array[ [1-a,0,0],
                        [a,1-c,b],
                        [0,c,1-b]]
                        
                        
output = pd.Dataframe(columns = ['day', 's', 'i', 'r'])
i = 0
vect = vect_initial.copy()

while i < steps
output.loc[index] = np.concatenate(np.array([index]),vect.T)
vect = np.matmul(matrix_step,vect)
i+=1
