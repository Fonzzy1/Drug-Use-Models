# SIR assumptions
- Individuals belong to one of three groups, susceptible, infected or recovered
- The normal SIR model assumes that recovered people cannot return to the infected category, this is not the case with drug use, where relapse is prevalent
- Change is limited to day by day
- the rate of movement between groups is linear such that:
$$ \frac{ds}{dt} = -a \cdot s $$
$$ \frac{di}{dt} = a \cdot s + b \cdot r - c  \cdot i $$
$$ \frac{dr}{dt} =  -b \cdot r + c \cdot i $$
It can be seen then:
$$ \frac{dr}{dt} + \frac{dr}{dt} + \frac{dr}{dt} = 0 $$

## Parameters:
a - rate people move from susceptible to infected as portion of total people
b - rate people move from recovered to infected as portion of total people
c - rate people move from infected to recovered as portion of total people

- This model is iterative, meaning $x_{n+1} = A \cdot x_n$, which can then be expanded over time.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pop_init = 1000

a = 0.001
b = 0.1
c = 0.5

steps = 1000

vect_initial = np.array([pop_init,0,0]).T # vector of day index, suseptable, infected and recovered people

matrix_step = np.array([ [1-a,0,0],
                        [a,1-c,b],
                        [0,c,1-b]])
                        
                        
output = pandas.DataFrame(columns = ['day', 's', 'i', 'r'])
i = 0
vect = vect_initial.copy()

while i < steps:
    output.loc[i] = np.concatenate((np.array([i]),vect.T))
    vect = np.matmul(matrix_step,vect)
    i+=1

plt.plot(output['day'],output['s'])
plt.plot(output['day'],output['i'])
plt.plot(output['day'],output['r'])
plt.legend(['s','i','r'])
plt.show()
